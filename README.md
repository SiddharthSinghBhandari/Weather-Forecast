This project is a fully functional weather forecast web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates API integration, DOM manipulation, and organized code structure using objects and functions. The application retrieves real-time weather data from the free WeatherAPI.com service and shows detailed weather metrics for several predefined cities in a clean table.

The system automatically loads data for each city, including Kolkata, Assam, Jaipur, Punjab, and London, by sending API requests using JavaScript’s fetch() method. When the data is received, the app processes the JSON response and updates each row in the HTML table. This way, users always see accurate, up-to-date information like feels-like temperature, current temperature, wind speeds (in mph and kph), humidity, and UV index.

A key goal of this project is to showcase clean, maintainable JavaScript code. All API-related tasks are organized into modular functions, and the entire workflow follows a straightforward object structure. This approach makes the code easier to expand. New cities can be added easily, and we can implement extra features like search input, dynamic row creation, or multi-day forecast support with minimal changes.

From a learning perspective, this project teaches key front-end development concepts such as API usage, asynchronous JavaScript (async/await), structured data handling, updating the user interface via DOM queries, and creating responsive table layouts. It emphasizes clear separation of concerns: HTML takes care of structure, CSS manages presentation, and JavaScript handles logic, data flow, and event management.

Overall, this weather app functions as both a useful tool and a strong example of front-end development skills. It combines real-time data fetching, user interface manipulation, clean coding practices, and API integration—all showcased through a simple and user-friendly dashboard. This makes it a valuable addition to a portfolio or GitHub repository, demonstrating technical skills and knowledge of modern web development practices.
